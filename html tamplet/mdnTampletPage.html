    <h1>
        <p>HTML layout elements in more detail</p>

    </h1>
    <p>It's good to understand the overall meaning of all the HTML sectioning elements in detail — </br>this is
        something you'll work on gradually as you start to get more experience with web development. You can find a lot
        of detail by reading our HTML element reference.</br> For now, these are the main definitions that you should
        try to understand:</p>
    <header>
        <h2>Header</h2>
        <p>header represents a group of introductory content.<br> If it is a child of body it defines the global header
            of a webpage,<br> but if it's a child of an article or section it defines a specific header for that section
            (try not to confuse this with titles and headings).</p>

    </header>

    <nav>
        <h2>NAV</h2>
        <p>contains the main navigation functionality for the page. Secondary links, etc., would not go in the
            navigation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Our team</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Projects</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>

        <!-- A Search form is another common non-linear way to navigate through a website. -->

        <form>
            <input type="search" name="q" placeholder="Search query">
            <input type="submit" value="Go!">
        </form>
    </nav>

    <!-- Here is our page's main content -->

    <main>
        <h2>MAIN</h2>
        <p>main is for content unique to this page. Use main only once per page, and put it directly inside body.
            Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.?<br>
            Each of the aforementioned elements can be clicked on to read the corresponding article in the "HTML element
            reference" section, providing more detail about each one.</p>
        <!-- It contains an article -->
        <article>

            <h2>Article heading</h2>
            <header>
                <p>header represents a group of introductory content.<br> If it is a child of body it defines the global
                    header
                    of a webpage,<br> but if it's a child of an article or section it defines a specific header for that
                    section
                    (try not to confuse this with titles and headings).</p>
            </header>
            <p>article encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page
                (e.g., a
                single blog post).</p>
            <section>
                <h2>SECTION</h2>
                <h3>section is similar to article,</h3>
                <p>but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of
                    functionality (e.g., a mini map, or a set of article headlines and summaries), or a theme. It's
                    considered
                    best practice to begin each section with a heading; <br> also note that you can break articles up
                    into
                    different sections, or sections up into different articles, depending on the context.</p>

                    <p>Non-semantic wrappers<br>
                        Sometimes you'll come across a situation where you can't find an ideal semantic element to group
                        some items
                        together or wrap some content. Sometimes you might want to just group a set of elements together
                        to affect them
                        all as a single entity with some CSS or JavaScript. For cases like these,<b>HTML provides the
                            div and span elements.</b> <br>You should use these preferably with a suitable class
                        attribute, to provide some kind of
                        label for them so they can be easily targeted.
                        <br><b>span</b> is an inline non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't think
                        of a better semantic text element to wrap your content, or don't want to add any specific
                        meaning.
